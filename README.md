# Postgres LOGGER
A project that is a brainchild of my work at Piramal Finance. I have built a logger library that can be used in various jobs and for each of these job runs, we would have the job statistics along with its transformations are logged onto Postgres database locally. The logger.py file is the library and the csv file illustrates a sample on how the data is logged.
